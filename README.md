# README

This repository consists of 2 folders: 
* `/data` - a repository for a Python3 command line tool to tap the rhythm of the opening bars of Opus 127. It was used repeatedly to write
`times.json`
* `/viz` - a repository for visualizing times.json in html/javascript with d3.js.

The interactive visualization can be viewed here: https://jsundram.github.io/maestoso-127/viz/
